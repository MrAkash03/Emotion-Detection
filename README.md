# Emotion-Detection
This project aims to detect human emotions from text inputs using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and a BERT-based transformer model. The model classifies emotions into 10 categories plus neutral, such as joy, anger, sadness, fear, love, surprise, disgust, optimism, pessimism, and neutral.
